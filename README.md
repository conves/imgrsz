### Image resizer microservice 
 
This is an image delivery Microservice. The service has a set of image files, stored in a local folder. 
It receives HTTP calls for those images on an endpoint (like `/image/img_012343.jpg`) and supports 
requests for various resolutions of those images. For instance, `/image/img_012343.jpg?size=300x400` 
will resize the original image at 300x400 and return it to the client. Its intended purpose is to serve images optimised 
for the device theyâ€™ll be displayed onto. For example, mobile devices will ask for lower resolutions while 
web applications will ask for higher resolutions or the original. 

Additional info: 
*  We do not know in advance the resolutions that the clients will ask for. 
*  It avoids resizing images that were previously resized to the same resolution (they're cached).
*  Other source images can be added in the folder at any time while the service is running. 
*  There's an endpoint to expose stats about the service, like: 
   *  The number of original files. 
   *  The number of resized files.
   *  Cache hits/misses. 
* It has a Dockerfile for running the service inside a container

#### Implementation details
It's built with Go 1.13 and exposes a http server on the port `8080`, with the following endpoints:
* `/image/{filename}?size=100x100` to serve images. The query string is optional.
* `/metrics` to export metrics from Prometheus agent (response time by statuses, number of cache hits/misses, etc.)
* `/docs` to serve a Swagger API documentation

Internally, it runs: 
* the web server, which, on its `/image` handler:
    * extracts image resizing details from the http request (original filename and size)
    * if there's no size provided, it tries to serve an original image, or respond with a 404 status
    * when there's a valid size in the query string, it tries to find a previously resized image by this particular size:
        * if image is to be found in cache (disk), it just serves it;
        * else:
            * it puts the image meta data (original filename, target size, etc) on a queue. This queue is abstracted through an interface, and the project comes with an implementation provided on top of a Redis list.  
            * it starts waiting for either:
                 * an ACK message on a bus (also an abstraction built on top of a Redis pub/sub). This ends up as a successful resize operation and the image can be served.
                 * a timeout (it can be configured through a flag at startup). In this case, it returns a 503 status to send a "too much load on the server" signal to the client.
* a configurable number of concurrent background workers. These workers:
    * extract new resize requests from the queue
    * do the actual image resizing and save the file on disk
    * once finished, a worker pushes an ACK message on a bus  

#### How to run it    
To start the containerized services (the app & Redis), simply run: 
```make run```

To run the all the tests (in a container), execute:
 ```make test```

**TODOs**
* add a distributed storage implementation for `ImageStore` interface
* add some cleanup (tearup & teardown) methods in tests
* improve Swagger docs
* add an architectural sketch to make it easier for potential reviewers to quickly grasp the internals
* extract the image resizing worker to a microservice of its own & adjust the docker-compose file
